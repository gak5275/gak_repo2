        <h3>My Experience with HTML and WordPress</h3>
        <p>Creating two websites from scratch using two different methods was a challenging but rewarding process. The most significant challenge was learning how each system worked. WordPress is user-friendly and fairly easy to navigate, but there is not really any menu system to guide you when coding with html. I imagine that html would be even more intimidating without any prior programming experience. That being said, I had somewhat of a hard time using WordPress after becoming so used to html and GitHub.</p>
        <p>One advantage that html/GitHub has is that you are in complete control of your website. In WordPress, a base of a website is already created whenever you start a new website. This base includes features that you may not want or need such as spaces for blog posts and comments, and it is not always made clear how to change this premade structure. In html, you are creating the entire website manually, including the foundation. It feels like you have a lot more control over the way your website looks.</p>
        <p>In html, you have free reign to design and organize your website however you want to look. As long as you know what code to write, anything is possible in html. WordPress has a less complicated, but also more limited way of altering the layout and design of your website (at least from my experience with it). There are many different themes you can choose for your website, but you cannot really edit them beyond changing the colors of certain elements. Editing a WordPress site can also be confusing because there are two different menus to use when doing so: “customize” and “edit page”. It can be hard to remember which options and tools are in which menu, and I wish that they had just combined the two together.</p>
        <p>In order to create a website using GitHub, you must of course learn how to code in html. I thought that this would be difficult before we started learning how to do it, but it was not as hard as I thought it would be. We have only been taught the basics so far, though. I imagine that the more advanced code is much more difficult to grasp. It also requires patience to develop a website, especially when using Git Bash to add, commit, and push every single change you make. It is a process of trial and error most of the time.</p>
        <p>I think that I could improve my website if I were to become more familiar with CSS. I tried to implement some CSS on a couple of my pages, but it did not have any effect on my site (the code is in there and not causing any errors, but the changes did not take effect). As it is right now, my GitHub page still looks like something a college student made. My WordPress site looks a bit cleaner, but that is only because of the premade theme. Utilizing CSS further could make my website look much more professional. Overall, creating a website was not as difficult of a task as I thought it would be, and I am glad to have the experience. Making it look professional is the hard part.</p>
