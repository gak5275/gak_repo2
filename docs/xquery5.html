                together?$l\Great!$h#$b#Meet me in the mountains at midnight tomorrow night.#$b#If
                it rains, we'll do it on the next night... the comet is here for a few days.\You
                think you're real smooth, don't you? Thought you'd sample the whole 'buffet', huh?

                so sick of preparing these samples...$s\Agh! Oh no!... $4\The whole sample is

                you hear that? That means someone just bought something from the store!$h\Hmm...
                There's this 'Mr. K' that keeps buying all my sculptures.$7#$b#I guess it must be
                some rich guy who loves my stuff.\Wow! I'm not going to have to worry about my
                electricity bill for a while after that sale...$6\Anyway... Thanks for giving me
                this idea, @. So far, it's been really successful! This is really going to give me
                the funding I need to keep working on art full-time.$h\Now, sorry to ignore you...
                but I really need to tweak these CSS sheets...$7\Sorry... I shouldn't get
                angry.$s\Maybe you're right... my life would've been a lot easier if I had
                stayed.$u#$b#Maybe it's better to be practical and realistic... for all I know my
                art career will never pan out and I'll live my final years in squalor.$s\Well,
                thanks for listening to me. It's good to have a friend.\So I've been saving up money
                to buy a computer... You know, so I can try and sell my art online like you
                suggested.\It's good to have a friend looking out for you!\Anyway... I've been
                thinking a little more about that art show idea you had.#$b#I'm working on some new
                sculptures to display at the show... I'm nervous, but the thought of getting my work
                out there is pretty exciting.#$b#I'm just glad you're on board with making Stardew
                Valley a premier art destination, @!$h\@! You're here!$h#$b#Okay... I guess I'd
                better introduce my pieces. Wish me luck!$l\Umm... Okay everyone!\Thanks for coming
                to my art show.$l\As some of you know, I came to this town because I wanted to draw
                inspiration from the beautiful surroundings.\This place really feels like home
                now.$h#$b#Okay. I'm going to introduce my sculptures now.\I haven't named this one,
                yet. She started out as an exercise in human anatomy, but I ended up seeing her
                through to completion.#$b#Her expression is intentionally unclear... is she
                embarrassed, amused, pained? I'll leave that for you to decide.\This one's called
                'Post-Dimensional Nullspace'. It represents the boundary of human
                imagination.$u#$b#The shape and color came to me vividly when I was in a 'trance
                state'.\I've been calling this one 'Egg Heads'. I wanted to create an animatronic
                humanoid statue to toy with the viewer's ability to properly attribute personhood to
                a physical entity. \And the last one is called 'Wood Sculpture 3'. It's a
                celebration of my favorite sculpting material... wood.\Well, those are my
                sculptures!$l#$b#Oh! One last thing.\I'd like to say thanks to my special friend,
                @.#$b#He gave me the idea for this show and the courage to go through with it. I
                know that sounds cheesy, but it's true.^She gave me the idea for this show and the

                funny.\I'm sorry about this, mom. I'll clean it up.$s\$p 81#I'm angry at you. I have
                no idea why you lied like that.$s|Sorry about what happened earlier.\I always knew
                there was something special between us...$l\I'm going to be thinking about this
                night for a long time...$l\...$l\I see...$s\I'm sorry... I had the wrong idea. I'll
                see you around.$7\...$s\Cool... @, are you ready to choose your character?\Cool.
                Warrior's my favorite anyway.\I guess I'm stuck with the healer.$s\Cool. Warrior's
                my favorite anyway.\...$s\Thanks, @.\Uh... Er... I... I'm sorry, sir.$8\Yes,
                sir.$7\...Did you see that trick, though? That was rad.$u\Hi @.#$b#I wanted to talk
                to you in private...\It's kinda cold out here though... let's sneak into my
                room.$u\So... @.$10#$b#I know I've been talking about nothing but the band for a
                while now... But I don't want you to think that's all I'm interested in.#$b#Um...
                Er... What I mean is...$8#$b#Well, I'm really happy that we've grown so close...
                Heh.$10\@... do you think of me as... just a friend?$l\Quick! Hide in the bed!$8\No
                Mom! I was just... doing push-ups! I wanna beat Dad at arm-wrestling some day!
                ...heh.$8\Goodnight, Mom.$10\Whew... That was close.$h\...@?\Earlier, I was trying
                to say... that I really like you, @. I think we could really have something special
                together... Know what I mean?\Alright, I said it.$7\I'm going to be thinking about
                this night for a long time...\...$l\</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>@?\Hey. I'm surprised to find you out here in the rain.\Look at those dark clouds
                looming over the horizon...\I hope they come this way.\I like this weather because
                it makes everyone disappear... you know?#$b#Being around people makes me feel
                anxious.$s\I don't feel that way around you, though.$7\We're getting
                soaked...\Here... There's room for two.$7\Our little friend's doing much better,
                see?\...but I don't think he can go back into the wild... he's not fast enough to
                avoid predators anymore.#$b#...So I set up this terrarium.#$b#He looks happy,
                doesn't he?$h\I wonder if he'll get lonely, though...\...a haven for frogs and toads
                who can't make it on their own? Not a bad idea.\He does look pretty tough. But
                still, If I find another injured frog, I think he'd be better off with a
                friend.\Hmm... Well, I like going out in the rain. So I guess I encountered a lot of
                frogs that way.#$b#I ended up feeling a common bond with the little guys.\Well it's
                not up for debate. This is my corner of the house and I can do what I want with
                it.\Yeah, It'll be fun. I spend a lot of time on the computer, so it's nice to have
                some real, physical hobbies.#$b#I might even try my hand at some frog
                breeding!$h\Oh, hello @.$8\What, you haven't seen my motorcycle before? Hmmm... I
                guess I haven't shown it to you.$8\Sometimes, after sundown, I make the long ride
                out of Stardew Valley...$8\There's nothing else like it, blazing along the empty
                stretch of road toward the faint city glow...$9\Once I've saved up enough money, I'm
                going to head out on my own... to the city and beyond. Just me and my bike.$9\There
                we go, oil's changed.$8\$q -1 null#Hey... Maybe I'll let you ride sometime, if you
                want.$8^Hey... maybe I'll take you for a ride some day.$8#$r -1 10
                event_garage1#That sounds fun.#$r -1 -10 event_garage2#No thanks. That sounds
                stupid.#$r -1 0 event_garage3#I'm scared of motorcycles.\Hey @. I was just about to
                head out.#$b#Hop on...I wanna show you something.\That's Zuzu City in the
                distance...\I come here when I want to get away from everything and just...
                think.\$q -1 null#So, what do you think?#$r -1 0 event_city1#It's beautiful.#$r -1
                10 event_city2#It gives me a strange, sad feeling.#$r -1 -10 event_city3#Kind of
                ugly.#$r -1 0 event_city4#You should quit smoking.\The city used to draw me in...
                but now I'm finding myself happier at home in the valley.\@...?$s#$b#Um... I've
                never... felt anything like this with another guy before... But you're
                different.$l^I don't usually bring girls to this place... In fact, you're the only
                one.$l#$b#You know what I'm trying to say, don't you?$l\Hey @... Glad you showed
                up.\There's an injured frog in that bush... I gotta save him!\I need your help. Go
                over to the bush and try to get him to come towards me. I'll wait over here and
                catch him.\Okay... you ready?\Now!\Got him!\Poor little guy... his foot's all
                mangled. $s\I'm gonna take him home for now, and make him comfortable.#$b#I guess
                I'll do some research on how to take care of frogs. Maybe Marnie knows
                something.\Hah... Yeah, I guess so.$h#$b#He's definitely got your nose...$7\Well,
                sorry if I don't take your word for it... I'm gonna give the poor guy a
                chance.\We'll do our best. But don't get too attached just yet...\Let's take him
                home.\Well? What do you have to say for yourself?$a\Absolutely.$a\You need to take
                responsibility for what you've done...$a\Absolutely.$a\...Okay.\Yea\Oh, hey. Gimme
                one sec.\Where are you going?$u\Sorry... I had to finish this line before I lost my
                train of thought.\Okay. Sorry about that, I just needed to finish what I was working
                on.\I do freelance work as a programmer.\Decorations?... Oh, yeah... thanks. I've
                been sticking posters on the wall for years, I guess it's kinda cluttered.\That was
                an instant message from Sam... I guess he wants to hang out...#$b#Ugh, I don't
                really feel like going out today.$u\Did you tell her I'm working?\*sigh*... No one
                takes my job seriously.$u#$b#No one ever bothers Maru when she's working at the
                clinic... does everyone think I'm just surfing the web all day?\Well, I'm trying to
                save up so I can move out of here. Probably to the city or something.\You know, If
                I'd gone to college I'd probably be making six figures right now... but I just don't
                want to be part of that corporate rat race, you know?#$b#Well, and I guess I just
                feel more comfortable hidden behind the computer than dealing with people
                face-to-face.$s\Well, I should get back to work... I need to get this module
                finished by tomorrow.\*sigh*... I like having friends, I just need a lot of time
                alone to balance out the social stuff.$s#$b#Sam's the opposite... he goes crazy if
                he's alone for too long.#$b#Maybe that's why I like computers so much... They're
                engaging, straightforward, and unselfish. Quite the opposite of a lot of people I
                know.\Well, I should get back to work... I need to get this module finished by
                tomorrow.\Hey, @. $7\Sam and I were about to play 'Solarion Chronicles: The Game'...
                Why don't you join us? It's better with three players anyway.$7\Okay, here we go...
                Let me draw the scenario card.$7\Hmm... It looks like today's quest will take us
                into the Necromancer's Tower... to try and reclaim the Solarion Staff from the
                clutches of Dreadlord Xarth.\Hey! That's what I was going to pick!$h#$b#I guess I'll
                be the healer then.\Good choice. Warrior's probably the easiest for
                beginners.$7#$b#I guess I'll pick the wizard, then.\Healer, huh? That's a very
                important role.$7#$b#I guess I'll pick the wizard, then.\Let's begin...\Thanks,
                @.$7\...$s\Hey, not bad!$7#$b#It took me like, three or four tries to beat my first
                scenario.$7\Thanks for stopping by... I'll see you later.$7\</li>
