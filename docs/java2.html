        <h2>Javascript Exercise 2</h2>
        <h3>Excerpt from <a href="https://gak5275.github.io/StardewDIGIT210/visual.html">The Stardew
                Valley Analysis</a></h3>
        <ul>

            <li><input type="checkbox" value="loc" />Locations</li>

        </ul>
        <p>This <span class="noun">network</span>
            <span class="verb">represents</span> the <span class="noun">characters</span> (in <span
                class="adj">green</span>
            <span class="noun">squares</span>) and the <span class="noun">locations</span> (in <span
                class="adj">blue</span>
            <span class="noun">circles</span>) in <span class="noun">Stardew Valley</span>. If a
                <span class="noun">square</span> and <span class="">circle</span> are <span
                class="adj">connected</span>, that <span class="noun">character</span>
            <span class="verb">appears</span> in that <span class="noun">location</span>
            <span class="adj">at least once</span> during <span class="noun">heart events</span>.
            The <span class="adj">bigger</span> one of them is, the more <span class="noun"
                >connections</span> it has.</p>
        <p>Based on this, it appears that <span class="loc">the Farm</span>, <span class="loc"
                >Pelican Town</span>, and <span class="loc">the Stardrop Saloon</span> are visited
            by the most characters. Pelican Town is the largest area in the game and is where most
            of the characters' homes and businesses are located, and about <span class="stat"
                >25</span> characters appear there. The Stardrop Saloon is a gathering place that
            many characters frequently visit, and about <span class="stat">16</span> characters
            appear there. The player's farm is visited by many characters throughout the game, and
            there are <span class="stat">13</span> characters who can potentially live on the farm
            with the player. There are about <span class="stat">17</span> characters who appear at
            the farm in total. Other locations with a lot of characters include more public open
            areas like the beach, the mountains, and Cindersap Forest.</p>
        <p>The characters who appear in the most locations during heart events are <span
                class="char">Abigail</span>, <span class="char">Emily</span>, <span class="char"
                >Sam</span>, and <span class="char">Harvey</span>, who each appear in 8 different
            locations. Shane, Penny, Robin, Sebastian, and Willy appear in 7 locations each. These
            characters tend to appear in both public areas like the town or the saloon, as well as
            locations that are only visited by them and one or two other people. Penny, for example,
            appears in large areas like Pelican Town and Cindersap Forest, but is also the only
            character who visits the spa and one of two who appear in her trailer. One exception to
            this is Shane. Every location that Shane appears in is visited by multiple other
            characters as well. He also happens to appear in more heart events than most others.
            Some characters only appear in a few events, and are connected to a small number of
            locations as a result. Other do show up in a lot of events, but most of them take place
            in just a few locations. Most of Leah's heart events, for example, take place either in
            her house or right outside of it.</p>
