        <h2>Corpus Analysis</h2>
        <p>For this assignment, I analyzed 16 txt files in the radioplays folder named suspense 1-16.</p>
        <p>Right click on a screenshot and select "Open image in new tab" to view it in greater detail.</p>

                <figcaption>According to Voyant, the five most used words in this collection of texts were: sound, oh, music, david, and yes. "sound" and "music" are most likely used so frequently because they are cues for when a music track or sound effect is supposed to play. Another interesting takeaway is that "david", the fourth most used word, appears to only be used in one or two of the plays. These plays are "suspense11" and "suspense12". "david" is the most used word in both of these plays, but the second and third most used words in these two texts are also the same. These words are "dorothy" and "woman". My guess is that these two plays are sequential, and one takes place after the other.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>This screenshot of AntConc shows the n-grams of the suspense files that are a minimum of three words and a max of five. Some of the most common n-grams are basic phrases like "I don't" and "I can't" (but without capitalization or apostrophes). The second most frequent 3 word n-gram is "Edward G Robinson". This must be the name of an important character in one of the radio plays. Other frequent n-grams include "then in bg", "music an accent", and "man in black". The first two are likely cues that are present because these are a radio play scripts, with bg being short for background. The "man in black" must be a major character in at least on of the plays.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>This screenshot confirms that the word "sound" is the most common word used throughout all of these texts because whenever it appears in one of the scripts, it is meant to be a cue that a sound effect is supposed to play. This also shows that it is not the same sound effect every time.</figcaption>
