      <p>At the turning of the Fourth Age, in the year 3E 433, <strong>the <span class="UrielSeptim">Emperor Uriel Septim VII</span> was
            assassinated</strong> and <strong>the <em>Amulet of Kings</em>
            was destroyed</strong>. This set in motion a chain of events that would bring
         down an empire and change forever the relationship between man and the gods.</p>
      
      
      <p><strong>The <span class="MythicDawn">assassins</span> first attacked the
            <span class="UrielSeptim">Emperor</span></strong> in the
         <b>White Gold Tower</b>. While the <span class="blades">Blades</span> held <span class="MythicDawn">them</span> back,
         <strong>the <span class="UrielSeptim">Emperor</span> made <span class="UrielSeptim">his</span> way down to the
            <b>dungeons</b></strong>, to a <b>secret escape
            route</b> built into <b>one of the prison cells</b>. For
         reasons known only to <span class="UrielSeptim">himself</span>, the <span class="UrielSeptim">Emperor</span>
         <strong>pardoned the fortunate <span class="hero">prisoner</span></strong> in that <b>cell</b>. Some say the
         <span class="hero">prisoner</span> reminded <span class="UrielSeptim">him</span> of a childhood friend. Others say it was a <strong>moment of
            prophecy</strong>. Whatever the case, the <span class="hero">prisoner</span> came to play a fateful role in the history of the
         <b>Empire</b> and <b>Tamriel</b> - surely a sign that
         the gods themselves were at work.</p>
      
      
      <p>The pursuing <strong><span class="MythicDawn">assassins</span> killed the
            <span class="blades">Blades</span> bodyguards</strong> in a relentless
         series of sneak attacks. Eventually <strong><span class="MythicDawn">they</span>
            struck down the <span class="UrielSeptim">Emperor</span>
            <span class="UrielSeptim">himself</span></strong>. Before <span class="UrielSeptim">he</span> fell, <strong><span class="UrielSeptim">Uriel Septim VII</span> gave the <em>Amulet of Kings</em> to
            the <span class="hero">prisoner</span></strong>, who somehow
         <strong>made it out of the <b>Imperial sewers</b></strong> and
         into the light of day.</p>
      
      
      <p>The assassination is now known to have been the work of a group of <span class="MythicDawn">daedric cultists</span> known as the <span class="MythicDawn">Mythic Dawn</span>. (Those who still suspect the <span class="DarkBrotherhood">Dark Brotherhood</span> should consider two facts: first, they would have only
         needed a single assassin, not a small army of them; second, the <span class="DarkBrotherhood">Dark Brotherhood</span> would never be so foolish as to
         <strong>effectively declare war on the Empire</strong> and thus ensure their
         complete destruction. Witness the eventual fate of the <span class="MythicDawn">Mythic
            Dawn</span>.)</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>The <em>Amulet of Kings</em> next surfaced at <b>Weynon
            Priory</b> near <b>Chorrol</b>. <span class="Jauffre">Jauffre</span>, secret <b>Grandmaster of the
            <span class="blades">Blades</span></b> and head of the
         <b>priory</b>, <strong>took possession of the
            <em>amulet</em></strong>. <strong>The <span class="hero">messenger</span> was sent off to <b>Kvatch</b></strong> to find a lowly <span class="MartinSeptim">priest</span> named <span class="MartinSeptim">Martin</span>.
         Unbeknownst even to <span class="MartinSeptim">himself</span>, <span class="MartinSeptim">Martin</span> was the bastard son of <span class="UrielSeptim">Uriel Septim VII</span>, and the last heir to the Ruby
         Throne. <span class="MartinSeptim">He</span> alone could use the
         <em>Amulet of Kings</em> to light the Dragonfires that wards the
         barrier between <b>Tamriel</b> and <b>Oblivion</b>, and save
         the world from the <span class="MythicDawn">Mythic Dawn</span> plot.</p>
      
      
      <p><strong>The <span class="hero">prisoner</span> arrived at <b>Kvatch</b></strong> to find <b>it</b> overrun by <span class="daedra">daedra</span> that had poured in
         from a newly-opened Oblivion Gate, the start of the Empire-spanning devastation of
         the
         Oblivion Crisis. How <strong>the <span class="hero">prisoner</span> closed
            the gate</strong> is not recorded. Once closed, <span class="MartinSeptim">Martin</span> and the surviving <b>Kvatch</b>
         <span class="empire">guardsmen</span> drove back the <span class="daedra">daedra</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Now known as the <b>Hero of <b>Kvatch</b></b>, <strong>the <span class="hero">prisoner</span> and <span class="MartinSeptim">Martin</span>
            returned to <b>Weynon Priory</b></strong>, only to find the
         <b>priory</b> sacked and the <em>Amulet</em> taken.
         <span class="Jauffre">Jauffre</span> survived the attack, however, and
         <strong>the three of them
            made their way to <b>Cloud Ruler Temple</b></strong>, bastion of
         the <span class="blades">Blades</span>. This secret <b>fortress</b> in
         the <b>mountains</b> outside <b>Bruma</b> is
         where <span class="MartinSeptim">Martin</span> was held safe while
         <strong>the <b>Hero of <b>Kvatch</b></b> searched for the lost
            <em>Amulet</em></strong>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Knowing only that a mysterious group called the <span class="MythicDawn">Mythic
            Dawn</span> was behind the <strong>assassination and theft of the
            <em>Amulet</em></strong>, <strong>the <b>Hero of <b>Kvatch</b></b> was sent to locate
            the <span class="MythicDawn">cult</span></strong>. With the help of
         Baurus, a <span class="blades">Blade</span> in the
         service of the <span class="UrielSeptim">Emperor</span>, they somehow <strong>used the
            <em>Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes</em></strong>,
         esoteric works by the madman <span class="MankarCamoran">Mankar Camoran</span>,
         to direct them to the <span class="MythicDawn">Mythic Dawn</span>'s secret <b>lair</b>. Scholars
         familiar with the <em>Commentaries</em> claim the location is not directly
         mentioned in <em>them</em>. How they did this remains a mystery.</p>
      
      
      <p>No official records exist of how <strong>the <b>Hero of
               <b>Kvatch</b></b> penetrated the <span class="MythicDawn">Mythic Dawn</span>'s <b>lair</b></strong>
         near <b>Lake Arrius</b>. There is a bardic tale that claims the <span class="hero">Hero</span> used <strong>trickery and disguise</strong>, but
         that is just speculation.What was discovered there is that <span class="MankarCamoran">Mankar Camoran</span> was behind the <span class="MythicDawn">Mythic Dawn</span>, and that the <span class="MythicDawn">group</span> worshiped the daedric prince <span class="MehrunesDagon">Mehrunes Dagon</span>. <span class="MankarCamoran">Mankar
            Camoran</span> believed <span class="MankarCamoran">himself</span> to
         be a direct descendant of the Camoran Usurper, the infamous
         pretender to the throne of <b>Valenwood</b>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Somehow <strong>the <span class="hero">Hero</span> escaped with the
            <em>Mysterium Xarxes itself</em></strong>, the holy book of
         the <span class="MythicDawn">Mythic Dawn cult</span>. <span class="MankarCamoran">Mankar Camoran</span> fled to <b>Oblivion</b> with the
         <em>Amulet of Kings</em>. With some effort and great risk to
         <span class="MartinSeptim">his</span> sanity, <strong><span class="MartinSeptim">Martin</span> deciphered the Mysterium
            Xarxes</strong> and intended to use <em>it</em> to open a gateway
         to <span class="MankarCamoran">Mankar Camoran</span> in order to recover the
         <em>Amulet of Kings</em>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Before <span class="MartinSeptim">Martin</span> could perform the ritual
         to open the gateway, <strong><span class="MehrunesDagon">Mehrunes
               Dagon</span> opened an Oblivion Gate outside <b>Bruma</b></strong>. <strong>The <b>Hero of
               <b>Kvatch</b></b> saved the <b>city</b> and <span class="MartinSeptim">Martin</span>
            by entering the gate and closing it</strong> before a <span class="daedra">daedric siege engine</span> could destroy <b>Bruma</b>
         and <b>Cloud Ruler Temple</b>. Many songs and stories have been told of
         this battle and I will not retell them here. The <b>Hero of <b>Kvatch</b></b> was now also known as the <b>Savior of <b>Bruma</b></b>.</p>
      
      
      <p>With the <b>city</b> and <b>Cloud Ruler
            Temple</b> safe, <strong><span class="MartinSeptim">Martin</span>
            opened the portal to <span class="MankarCamoran">Mankar Camoran</span>'s
            "<b>Paradise</b>"</strong>. The details of what transpired in
         this <b>place</b> have not been recorded. All that is known is that
         <strong>the <b>Savior of <b>Bruma</b></b> travelled to this <b>Paradise</b>,
            killed <span class="MankarCamoran">Mankar Camoran</span>, and returned with
            the <em>Amulet of Kings</em></strong>.</p>
      
      
      <p>With the <em>Amulet</em> in hand, <strong><span class="MartinSeptim">Martin Septim</span> presented <span class="MartinSeptim">himself</span> to the <span class="empire">Elder
               Council</span> to be crowned <b>Emperor of all
               <b>Tamriel</b></b></strong>. Once crowned <span class="MartinSeptim">he</span> planned to relight the Dragonfires and seal
         <b>Tamriel</b> from <b>Oblivion</b>. In a last-ditch
         attempt to stop <span class="MartinSeptim">him</span>, <strong><span class="MehrunesDagon">Mehrunes Dagon</span> launched an assault on the
            <b>Imperial City</b>, opening several Oblivion Gates
            within the <b>capital</b> itself</strong>. Uncrowned,
         <span class="MartinSeptim">Martin</span> joined the battle in the <b>city streets</b>.</p>
      
      
      <p><strong><span class="MehrunesDagon">Mehrunes Dagon himself</span>
            left <b>Oblivion</b> and entered
            <b>Tamriel</b></strong>, breaking the covenant. Only the unlit
         Dragonfires allowed this to be possible. Now that the barrier was ripped asunder,
         it was
         too late to relighting the Fires. <span class="MartinSeptim">Martin
            Septim</span> chose to make the ultimate sacrifice - <strong><span class="MartinSeptim">he</span> shattered the <em>Amulet of
               Kings</em> to become the <span class="MartinSeptim">avatar of the god
               Akatosh</span> and do battle with <span class="MehrunesDagon">Mehrunes
               Dagon</span></strong>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Records of this battle vary wildly. What we do know is that
         <strong><span class="MehrunesDagon">Mehrunes Dagon</span> was
            defeated and sent back to <b>Oblivion</b></strong>.
         <strong>The <span class="MartinSeptim">avatar of Akatosh</span> was
            turned to stone</strong> and can be seen to this day in the <b>Temple of
            the One</b> in the <b>Imperial City</b>. With the
         <em>Amulet</em> gone, the Dragonfires quenched, and the last
         Dragonblood Emperor dead, the barrier to <b>Oblivion</b> is sealed
         forever.</p>
