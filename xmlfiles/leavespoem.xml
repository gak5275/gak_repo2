    <title>Leaves</title>
    <metadata>Lloyd Schwartz - 1941-</metadata>

    <stanza n="1"> Every October it becomes important, no, necessary to see the <nature
            type="plants">leaves</nature> turning, to be surrounded by <nature type="plants"
            >leaves</nature> turning; it's not just the symbolism, to confront in the death of the
        year your death, one blazing farewell appearance, though the irony isn't lost on you that
        nature is most seductive when it's about to die, flaunting the dazzle of its incipient exit,
        an ending that at least so far the effects of <industry type="consequences">human progress
            (pollution, acid rain)</industry> have not yet frightened you enough to make you believe
        is real; that is, you know this ending is a deception because of course nature is always
        renewing itself— the <nature type="plants">trees</nature> don't die, they just pretend, go
        out in style, and return in style: a new style. </stanza>

    <stanza n="2">
        <l>Is it deliberate how far they make you go</l>
        <l>especially if you live in the <industry type="manmade">city</industry> to get far</l>
        <l>enough away from home to see not just <nature type="plants">trees</nature></l>
        <l>but only <nature type="plants">trees</nature>? The boring <industry type="manmade"
                >highways, roadsigns, high</industry></l>
        <l><industry type="manmade">speeds, 10-axle trucks</industry> passing you as if they
            were</l>
        <l>in an even greater hurry than you to look at <nature type="plants">leaves</nature>:</l>
        <l>so you drive in terror for literal hours and it looks</l>
        <l>like <nature type="weather">rain, or snow</nature>, but it's probably just <nature
                type="weather">clouds</nature></l>
        <l>(too cloudy to see any color?) and you wonder,</l>
        <l>given the poverty of your memory, which road had the</l>
        <l>most color last year, but it doesn't matter since</l>
        <l>you're probably too late anyway, or too early—</l>
        <l>whichever road you take will be the wrong one and you've probably come all this way for
            nothing.</l>
    </stanza>

    <stanza n="3"> You'll be driving along depressed when suddenly a <nature type="weather"
            >cloud</nature> will move and the <nature type="weather">sun</nature> will muscle
        through and ignite the <nature type="plants">hills</nature>. It may not last. Probably won't
        last. But for a moment the whole world comes to. Wakes up. Proves it lives. It lives—
            <nature type="plants">red, yellow, orange, brown, russet, ocher, vermilion,
            gold</nature>. <industry type="consequences">Flame and rust. Flame and rust, the
            permutations of burning</industry>. You're on fire. Your eyes are on fire. It won't
        last, you don't want it to last. You can't stand any more. But you don't want it to stop.
        It's what you've come for. It's what you'll come back for. It won't stay with you, but
        you'll remember that it felt like nothing else you've felt or something you've felt that
        also didn't last. </stanza>
